# Task Manager Project

## Introduction

Welcome to the Task Manager Project! This project is designed to help you apply and reinforce the Python concepts you've learned over the past 8 weeks. You'll be working with a basic Flask web application that manages tasks, demonstrating your understanding of Python programming, web development basics, and data visualization.

## Project Overview

The Task Manager is a web application with the following features:

- User registration and authentication
- Create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations for tasks
- Data visualization of task completion status

## Your Task

Your mission is to extend and improve the existing Task Manager application. We've provided a basic structure and some core functionality. Your job is to enhance the application by adding new features and improving the existing ones.

## Getting Started

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Set up a virtual environment

      python3 -m venv venv_name
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate

- Install the required packages:

      pip install -r requirements.txt

- Run the application

      python run.py

## Your Tasks

### Enhance Task Management

* Add the ability to set due dates for tasks.
* Implement task categories or tags.
* Add a priority level for tasks (e.g., High, Medium, Low).


### Improve Data Visualization

* Create a bar chart showing tasks by category.
* Implement a line graph showing task completion over time.
* Add a pie chart for task priorities.


### User Experience Improvements

* Implement task sorting (by due date, priority, etc.).
* Add a search functionality for tasks.
* Create a user profile page where users can see their statistics.


### Advanced Features (Choose at least one)

* Implement email notifications for upcoming due dates.
* Add a "Share Task" feature where users can assign tasks to other users.
* Create a RESTful API for the Task Manager.


### Code Quality and Best Practices

* Ensure your code follows PEP 8 guidelines.
* Write unit tests for your new features.
* Document your code using docstrings.


### Deployment

Deploy your application to a free hosting service like Heroku or PythonAnywhere.



## Evaluation Criteria

Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

* **Functionality**: Does the application work as expected? Are all features implemented correctly?
* **Code Quality**: Is the code well-organized, commented, and following Python best practices?
* Creativity: How well have you extended the basic functionality with your own ideas?
* **User Experience**: Is the application intuitive and easy to use?
* **Technical Understanding**: Does your implementation demonstrate a good understanding of the concepts learned in the course?

## Submission
To submit your project:

* Push your code to a GitHub repository.
* Provide the URL of your deployed application (if applicable).
* Submit a brief report (max 2 pages) describing the features you implemented, any challenges you faced, and how you overcame them.

## Resources

* Flask Documentation
* Matplotlib Documentation
* Python PEP 8 Style Guide

**Good luck, and happy coding! Remember, the goal is not just to complete the project, but to learn and have fun in the process. Don't hesitate to ask questions if you need clarification or assistance.**
